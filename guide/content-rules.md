# Understaning Website Content

A website consists of pages organized in a way that makes sense for its visitors - like a home page, product pages, about page, and so on. Each page is built from sections that serve different purposes, such as introducing a company, showcasing features, or presenting a team.

## Page Sections

Every page is made up of sections. Each section:

-   Has a specific purpose (hero banner, feature showcase, team presentation, etc.)
-   Uses a design style (what we call a component) that best fits its purpose
-   Contains content that you can write and edit like a regular rich text document

## Writing Section Content

Think of each section's content like a mini-document. Just like in a word processor, you can:

-   Use headings to organize your content
-   Add images where they make sense
-   Write paragraphs of text
-   Create ordered and unordered lists
-   Format text as bold or italic
-   Include links to other pages

Many sections organize content into meaningful groups. For example:

-   A features section might have a main introduction followed by individual feature descriptions
-   A team section might show several team member profiles
-   A testimonial section might display multiple customer quotes

## How Images Work

Images can play different roles depending on where you place them:

1. **Background Images**: When you add an image before a heading, it's typically used as a background
2. **Foreground Images**: Images placed after headings are usually shown as regular content images
3. **Gallery Images**: Multiple images placed together might form a gallery or carousel

## Using Headings to Structure Your Content

Headings help organize your content clearly. You have three heading sizes to work with:

-   # Large heading (H1)
-   ## Medium heading (H2)
-   ### Small heading (H3)

Here's a typical Features section:

```
# Why Choose Our Platform
An introduction to our key features...

## Smart Integration
Details about our integration features...

## Advanced Analytics
Details about our analytics features...

## 24/7 Support
Details about our support services...
```

In this example:

-   The main introduction uses a large heading (# means H1)
-   Each feature uses a medium heading (## means H2)
-   The hierarchy makes the structure clear

You could also use:

```
## Why Choose Our Platform
An introduction to our key features...

### Smart Integration
Details about our integration features...

### Advanced Analytics
Details about our analytics features...
```

Both styles work well - use what feels right for your content. What matters is keeping a consistent hierarchy of heading levels within each section.

## Common Section Types and Examples

### Hero Section 

A hero section may show slides, each with a background image, headings, and foreground media:

```
[Hero background image]
## Welcome to the Future
Transform your business with our platform
[Foreground image or screenshot]

---
[Second slide background]
## Innovation at Work
See how our solutions drive growth
[Product showcase YouTube video]
```

### Features Section

Typically has a main introduction followed by individual features:

```
# Our Features
What makes us different...

## Advanced Technology
[Feature illustration]
Using cutting-edge solutions...

## Expert Support
[Support team photo]
Our team is here 24/7...
```

### Team Section

Shows team members as equal content groups:

```
## Sarah Chen
### Lead Designer

## Alex Rodriguez
### Lead Developer

```

### Content Showcase Section

Demonstrates using background and foreground images effectively:

```

# Our Studio
### Silicon Valley
Where innovation happens...
[Detail photos of the workspace]

## Our Process

```

## Advanced Organization

### Adding Context with Small Headings

Sometimes you want to add context above your main heading:

```
### Design Tools
# Transform Your Workflow
Our suite of design tools...
```

Here, "Design Tools" provides category context for the main heading.

### Using Separators to Group Content

When you want to separate content without relying on headings, use separator lines (---):

```
[Team photo]
About this team member...
---
[Another photo]
About another team member...
```

Separators are particularly useful for:

-   Slides in a carousel
-   Equal-importance content groups
-   When headings would be redundant

## Tips for Success

1. **Plan Your Structure**

    - Think about the main message of your section
    - Organize related content into clear groups
    - Use heading sizes consistently
    - Place images thoughtfully (before headings for backgrounds, after for content)

2. **Write Naturally**

    - Create content as you would in a regular document
    - Focus on clarity and readability
    - Use formatting to enhance understanding

3. **Use Images Effectively**

    - Place background images before their related headings
    - Group related images together for galleries
    - Add descriptive captions when helpful

4. **Preview and Refine**
    - Check how your content looks in the chosen design
    - Adjust heading levels if needed
    - Verify image placements achieve desired effects
    - Make sure your content flows well

Remember, focus on creating good content - the design style will handle making it look great on your website. When in doubt, write naturally and preview how it looks in your chosen design style.

## Need Help?

-   Preview your content frequently to see how it works with your chosen design
-   Try different heading levels if the hierarchy isn't quite right
-   Keep content groups clear and logical
-   Use explicit dividers (---) if headings are not a natural group indicator

The best content often comes from writing naturally while keeping these basic principles in mind.
